# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course, I was looking to understand data structures, and define the best data structure for different use cases and how to implement these data structures. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first approached the problem by looking at the data I was attempting to load, and understanding how the data would be accessed and used by end users. It is important to understand this, because different data structures are better in different use-cases, but they will always be necessary when working with code to make large amounts of data more accessible. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
In general, there was a lot of use of stackoverflow to understand different parts of the project I might not have understood, and using youtube videos that explained data structures to supplement my knowledge as well. A mixture of all of these and some light use of the ZyBooks information helped pull all the variables together so I could create a working data structure. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Now that I know different data structures besides just a standard vector, it is easy to look at problems with big amounts of data and put together the outline for a program in my head; whereas before looking at large amounts of data was a bit overwhelming. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Since I chose to use a Binary Search Tree to write this code, there were a lot of small portions that needed to be updated. It was very important as I was going through the code to ensure I had readable comments throughout the code, and kept all the different parts of the code as functions. In fact, the only line of code in Main() was to call a function, so this code is very maintainable and adaptable to other programs as well.
